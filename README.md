## unlocked_mp.CT
This script allows you to place down your summon sign and get summoned nearly anywhere.

How to use:
Load the table in cheat engine (if you have other tables open, simply select yes when it asks whether to merge them), then select the unlocked mp script, it will then show you two entries, make sure you are in game and wait until the mp_area_id has a numerical value rather than ??, then simply enable the freeze mp_id script and you will be able to place your sign anywhere.

Important notes:
1. Only use red/white signs! Anything else will at best not work and at worst result in you falling through the world and dying.
2. Do not keep this enabled in regular area's! If people invade you while this is enabled it will result in them falling through the world and dying.

Limitations:
1. In some places like firelink, if you move too much after placing your sign it will dissapear, just stand still while you are waiting to be summoned.
2. Summoning in most boss arena's doesn't work, you can still play in them by simply summoning in the regular area, then disabling gravity and collision to get through the fog gate, because you are still technically in the same area the game will not disconnect you.
3. What is true for boss arena's also seems to be true for the valley of the drakes, it is technically part of new londo, so simply enter from there.
